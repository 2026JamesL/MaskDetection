Due to COVID and other respiratory diseases, crowded areas have become hazardous, and finding safer areas with more well-masked people can be hard with the human eye. We investigated and compared the accuracy and efficiency of fine tuned object detection algorithms such as YOLO and R-CNN on mask detection and classification of large crowds of people. In particular, we used transfer learning with popular object detection learning algorithms and datasets such as the YOLO medical mask dataset to detect people's faces and their masks and classify whether they were wearing a mask correctly, wearing a mask incorrectly, or not wearing a mask.
